# Course Description
*(i) Cryptography and cryptographic algorithms such as AES, stream ciphers; (ii) Different types of side-channel attacks and countermeasures; (iii) Supply-chain vulnerabilities – hardware Trojans, IP piracy, and reverse engineering; (iv) Security modules for system-on-chip; and (v) Physical unclonable functions.*

 

# Course Prerequisites
*Grade of C or better in ECEN 350; and/or instructor’s approval. This course contains labs that require the knowledge of using IC design tools, HDL (VHDL/Verilog) programming, basic knowledge of computer architecture, and proficiency in programming.*

 

# Special Course Designation
**ECEN 426 Distance Learning (Sect. 500)**

There is one distance learning (DL) section of the course. DL students are responsible for all the same labs and exams as local 426 students. DL students will be graded the same as local 426 students. 

Upon request via email, the TAs and/or instructor will be available for virtual office visits via eCampus Collaborate Ultra (click on the “DL TA/Instructor Discussion” link in eCampus at the agreed upon time and then click on the “Course Room”).

Lectures will be automatically recorded and will populate in eCampus sometime in the afternoon/evening of the day they are recorded for DL students to watch off-line. 

DL students will complete the labs and demo the working labs with the TAs via eCampus Collaborate Ultra. DL students may want to buy a MasterLock. 

The instructor will contact DL students individually to make arrangements for the students to complete the exams.

 

# Course Learning Outcomes
* Ability to design, analyze, and simulate cryptographic algorithms.
* Ability to perform side-channel attacks
* Ability to identify security bugs in an SoC
* Ability to design, analyze, and attack defense techniques in IC.
 

# Textbook and/or Resource Materials
There is no recommended text book for this course. All relevant notes and materials will be posted on the course website.

 

# Grading Policy
Final grades in this course will be based on several lab assignments given throughout the semester, class participation, and a final project. Scribing and projects can be done in a group of no more than 3 students. This course has no midterms and finals.



*The tentative grading policy is:*

| Assignment  | % |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Labs  | 45%  |
| Midterm project presentation & report  | 20%  |
| Final Project presentation & report  | 20%  |

| Attendance  | 5%|


# Grading scale:

 

A 90–100% 

B 80–89.99%

C 70–79.99%

D 60–69.99%

F 0–59.99%

# Attendance
By default, every student earns 5% for attendance but for every missed class they lose 0.5%. Note that this deduction is not applicable to university-approved absences or those permitted by the instructor.

 

# Operational Details for Course in the Online Mode:

Students taking the course from the online mode of instruction are required to turn on cameras during class. The university’s new Bring Your Own Device policy requires that students have access to a webcam.
Lectures will be delivered synchronously (during the scheduled lecture time slots) via Zoom. Lecture videos (recorded from Zoom) and lecture slides will be made available to the students.
Students are strongly encouraged to attend the synchronous lectures and participate in the class discussions.
 

# Late Work Policy
If the absence is excused, the instructor will provide the student an opportunity to make up any quiz, exam or other work that contributes to the final grade or provide a satisfactory alternative by a date agreed upon by the student and instructor.  If an instructor has a regularly scheduled make-up exam, students are expected to attend unless they have a university-approved excuse.  The make-up work must be completed within a timeframe not to exceed 30 calendar days from the last day of the initial absence.

# University Policies
This section outlines the university level policies. The TAMU Faculty Senate established the wording of these policies.

[NOTE: Faculty members should not change the written statements. A faculty member may add separate paragraphs if additional information is needed.]

# Attendance Policy

# Makeup Work Policy
Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance contributes to a student’s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor.

Please refer to Student Rule 7Links to an external site. in its entirety for information about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1Links to an external site.).

“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2Links to an external site.).

“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” (Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20Links to an external site.).

With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets the following conditions (see University Rule 08.01.01.M1Links to an external site.):

The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment.
The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University.
Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention – including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation.
