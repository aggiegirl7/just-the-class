*The following notes are from the book "Power Analysis" by Stefan Mangard*

## Smart Cards
* most popular kind of cryptographic devices 
* most of them are equipped with a microcontroller
* In 2003 - 1 billion smart cards  
     2006 - 2 billion  
     2018 - ?  
     
 #### Most of them are used in security- sensitive applications such as...
